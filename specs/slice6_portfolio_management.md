- **Purpose**: Provide real-time portfolio valuation data
- **Activities**: `FetchPortfolioPositions`, `CalculatePortfolioValue`, `GetMarketData`
- **Performance**: High-frequency updates for accurate portfolio valuation
- **Scaling**: Handle large portfolios with hundreds of positions

#### Trading Worker
- **Task Queue**: trading-queue
- **Purpose**: Execute rebalancing trades and portfolio adjustments
- **Activities**: `ExecuteRebalancingTrades`, `OptimizeTradeExecution`, `ManageOrderFlow`
- **Coordination**: Receives rebalancing instructions from monitoring workflows
- **Compliance**: Ensure all portfolio trades meet regulatory requirements

#### Risk Management Worker
- **Task Queue**: risk-queue
- **Purpose**: Continuous portfolio risk assessment and limit enforcement
- **Activities**: `CalculatePortfolioRisk`, `ValidateRebalancing`, `MonitorExposure`
- **Critical**: Real-time risk monitoring across entire portfolio

### Cross-Worker Coordination
- **Portfolio Valuation**: Market Data → Monitoring (valuation updates)
- **Rebalancing Flow**: Monitoring → Risk → Trading (rebalancing execution)
- **Risk Monitoring**: All workers → Risk (continuous risk assessment)
- **Performance Analytics**: Market Data + Trading → Monitoring (performance calculation)
- **Opportunity Detection**: Scanner → Monitoring (rebalancing triggers)

### Workflow Orchestration
- **Central Coordination**: Monitoring worker orchestrates all portfolio operations
- **Parallel Processing**: Market data and risk calculations run in parallel
- **Sequential Validation**: Risk validation before trade execution
- **Event-Driven**: Portfolio changes trigger cross-worker activities
- **State Consistency**: Portfolio state maintained across worker boundaries

### Scaling Considerations
- **Portfolio Size**: Workers scale based on number of positions and complexity
- **Update Frequency**: Market data workers scale for real-time portfolio valuation
- **Trade Volume**: Trading workers scale for rebalancing execution capacity
- **Risk Complexity**: Risk workers scale for sophisticated portfolio risk models
- **Analysis Depth**: Scanner workers scale for comprehensive market analysis
