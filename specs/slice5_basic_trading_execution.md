# Slice 5: Basic Trading Execution

## Overview
End-to-End Feature: Execute trading decisions based on signal evaluation activities
Deliverable: Paper trading system that executes trades based on LLM-evaluated signals from MultiStockMonitoringWorkflow

## Architecture Integration
The trading execution system integrates with the workflow architecture through:
- **Signal Evaluation**: Receives evaluated signals from `EvaluateSignal` activities
- **Trading Workflow**: Executes `TradeExecutionWorkflow` based on evaluation results
- **Decision Activities**: Uses `MakeTradingDecision` and `ExecuteTrade` activities
- **Risk Assessment**: Integrates risk evaluation within trading decision activities
- **Feedback Loop**: Provides execution results back to monitoring workflows

## Multi-Worker Architecture

### Primary Workers

#### Trading Worker
- **Task Queue**: trading-queue
- **Purpose**: Handle order execution and trading operations
- **Workflows**: `TradeExecutionWorkflow`
- **Activities**: `MakeTradingDecision`, `ExecuteTrade`, `ValidateOrder`, `SubmitOrder`
- **Requirements**: Low latency (< 10ms), high reliability
- **Compliance**: Regulatory controls, audit trails, order validation
- **Scaling**: Dedicated instances for trading operations, no shared resources

#### Risk Management Worker
- **Task Queue**: risk-queue
- **Purpose**: Real-time risk calculations and monitoring
- **Activities**: `CalculatePositionRisk`, `ValidateRiskLimits`, `AssessPortfolioRisk`
- **Performance**: Real-time risk evaluation (< 50ms)
- **Critical**: Real-time enforcement of risk limits, circuit breakers
- **Reliability**: 99.99% availability requirement

### Supporting Workers

#### Monitoring Worker
- **Integration**: Continues to run monitoring workflows and signal evaluation
- **Communication**: Sends evaluated signals to trading workers
- **Coordination**: Orchestrates overall trading process

#### Market Data Worker
- **Integration**: Provides real-time price data for trading decisions
- **Performance**: Critical for order timing and execution prices

### Worker Coordination
- **Signal Flow**: Monitoring → Trading → Risk → Execution
- **Risk Validation**: All trades validated by risk worker before execution
- **Cross-Worker Communication**: Temporal activities span worker boundaries
- **Failure Isolation**: Trading failures don't affect monitoring operations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction logging across all workers

### Security and Compliance
- **Trading Worker**: Isolated environment, restricted network access
- **Risk Worker**: Independent validation, cannot be bypassed
- **Audit Logging**: All trading activities logged with full context
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Worker separation supports regulatory requirements
