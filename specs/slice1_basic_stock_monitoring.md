# Slice 1: Basic Stock Monitoring (MVP)

## Overview
End-to-End Feature: Monitor one stock and log price changes
Deliverable: Working system that monitors AAPL and logs price movements using configurable broker

## Multi-Worker Architecture

### Primary Worker: Monitoring Worker
- **Task Queue**: monitoring-queue
- **Purpose**: Execute stock monitoring workflows and coordinate basic monitoring activities
- **Workflows**: `StockMonitoringWorkflow`
- **Activities**: Basic monitoring coordination, workflow state management
- **Scaling**: Single instance sufficient for basic monitoring (1-10 stocks)
- **Performance**: < 1s latency for workflow operations

### Supporting Workers (Future Slices)
- **Market Data Worker**: Will handle high-frequency price fetching in later slices
- **Trading Worker**: Will be introduced in Slice 5 for trade execution
- **Scanner Worker**: Will be added for market scanning capabilities
- **Risk Worker**: Will provide risk management in trading slices

### Implementation Notes
- This slice focuses on the monitoring worker foundation
- Broker integration activities run within the monitoring worker
- Future slices will introduce specialized workers for performance optimization
- Worker separation enables independent scaling and fault isolation
