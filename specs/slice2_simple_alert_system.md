# Slice 2: Simple Alert System

## Overview
End-to-End Feature: Add configurable alerts when price changes exceed thresholds
Deliverable: Alert system that notifies when AAPL moves >5% in either direction

## Multi-Worker Architecture

### Primary Workers

#### Monitoring Worker
- **Task Queue**: monitoring-queue
- **Purpose**: Execute alert monitoring workflows and threshold evaluation
- **Workflows**: `StockMonitoringWorkflow` with alert capabilities
- **Activities**: Alert threshold evaluation, notification triggering, alert state management
- **Scaling**: Handle multiple stocks with different alert configurations
- **Performance**: < 1s latency for alert detection and notification

#### Scanner Worker (Future Enhancement)
- **Task Queue**: scanner-queue
- **Purpose**: Scan multiple stocks for alert conditions simultaneously
- **Activities**: Bulk threshold scanning, market-wide alert detection
- **Performance**: Handle 1,000+ stocks for alert scanning
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability for continuous market monitoring

### Supporting Workers

#### Market Data Worker
- **Integration**: Provides real-time price data for alert evaluation
- **Performance**: Critical for timely alert detection
- **Activities**: Price fetching optimized for alert threshold comparison

### Worker Coordination
- **Alert Detection**: Monitoring workers evaluate price changes against thresholds
- **Notification Flow**: Alert detection → Notification activities → External systems
- **State Management**: Alert states tracked within monitoring workflows
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling of monitoring vs. data fetching operations

### Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Implement alerts within existing monitoring worker
- **Phase 2**: Add scanner worker for multi-stock alert scanning
- **Phase 3**: Optimize with dedicated alert processing queues
- **Performance**: Worker separation enables alert-specific optimizations
